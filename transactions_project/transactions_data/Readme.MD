The dataset used for transactions is retrieved from this CSV file-
https://drive.google.com/file/d/10vNxDkHpxnVKwruU5Hh8RXXdWenq0xRj/view?usp=sharing

Due to lack of time, wasn't able to deploy it to the cloud(really sorry for that), but accomplied first two tasks of-
1.Database setup
2.File upload API
3. Transactions API

The transactions_data directory consists of the main code that I wrote, in view.py there are the 4 APIs taht I created to upload, get all transactions, delete, update transactions

The urls.py file in transactions_data consits of the API calls that is declared in the views.py file.

models.py and serializers.py consists info for the DB craetion and the model creation.
